    "text": "Over the 5 years that I have been into Data Sciences and Machine Learning, the core thing I have learnt is to solve business problems. I am into building and executing solutions, that are fast paced and scalable. Unbounded by tech stacks, I aim to get systems up and running and establish quick feedback loops to generate lasting impact.\nAt Shiprocket, I have custom built data heavy and scalable ML pipelines, solving problems in realms of Tabular ML, NLP and time-series forecastings. I am also exploring interesting use cases that can be solved with the newly emergent field of GenAI. Before this, I had a short stint at Whitehat Jr. an Ed-Tech company, where I did a lot of clustering, segmentation and data crunching, besides building some dashboards (used by CxO folks).\nI began and evolved into data from EXL, where I transformed multiple slow and monolithic pre-existing data and machine learning projects built in propriety tools into fast, modular, interpretable and user-friendly solutions.\nIn general, I command strong hold in building and setting up data intensive solutions. Some of my key projects are listed here. I also undertake courses and certifications to keep myself up to date with this rapidly evolving domain.\nI have no defined interests üôà and take up and try different things. Trying to keep a memoir here. Besides that, I am a watch afficionado and üç∫ buff.\nI also try to maintain some lists for my:\n\nplaylists üéµ\n\nbooks üìñ\n\nmovies üé•\n\nwebsites üåê"
