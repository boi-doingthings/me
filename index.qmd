Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! I am Yash, currently working as a GPU Developer Advocate at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/) with the [OpenHackathons Group](https://www.openhackathons.org/s/).   

Prior to this, I was a Manager & Lead Data Scientist with an unicorn startup [Shiprocket](https://www.shiprocket.in/) in the realms of Logistics, Retail and E-Commerce.  

For over 5 years, I've been transforming data (big and small) across modalities into actionable insights that drive results. My core areas of expertise are in traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning and I am actively venturing into the realms of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically Generative AI. You can find more details about me [here](about.html).

Please feel free to reach out to me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boi-doingthings/) or [X](https://twitter.com/boi_doingthings) or have a few words with my AI [assistant/secretary](https://hf.co/chat/assistant/66094d23a258db9f29b6c7eb) ðŸ˜„.
