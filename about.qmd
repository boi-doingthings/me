Over the 5 years that I have been into Data Sciences and Machine Learning, the core thing I have learnt is to solve business problems. I am into building and executing solutions, that are fast paced and scalable. Unbounded by tech stacks, I aim to get systems up and running and establish quick feedback loops to generate lasting impact.

At [Shiprocket](https://www.shiprocket.in/), I have custom built data heavy and scalable ML pipelines, solving problems in realms of Tabular ML, NLP and time-series forecastings. Before this, I had a short stint at an Ed-Tech company, where I did a lot of clustering, segmentation and data crunching, besides building some dashboards (used by CxO folks). I began and evolved into data from [EXL](https://www.exlservice.com/), where I transformed multiple slow and monolithic pre-existing data projects built in propriety tools into fast, modular, interpretable and user-friendly solutions.

In general, I command strong hold in building and setting up data intensive solutions. Some of my key projects are listed [here](projects.html). 

I have no defined interests üôà and take up and try different things. Trying to keep a memoir [here](). Besides that, I am a watch afficionado and üç∫ buff.
