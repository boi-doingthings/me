title: "About Me"
---

Over the 5 years that I have been into Data Sciences and Machine Learning, the core thing I have learnt is to solve business problems. I am into building and executing solutions, that are fast paced and scalable. Unbounded by tech stacks, I aim to get systems up and running and establish quick feedback loops to generate lasting impact.

At [Shiprocket](https://www.shiprocket.in/), I have custom built data heavy and scalable ML pipelines, solving problems in realms of Tabular ML, NLP and time-series forecastings. I am also exploring interesting use cases that can be solved with the newly emergent field of GenAI, with disrupting postive impact to existing functions across business lines. Before this, I had a short stint at [Whitehat Jr.](https://www.whitehatjr.com/) an Ed-Tech company, where I did a lot of clustering, segmentation and data crunching, besides building some dashboards (used by CxO folks).  

I began and evolved into data from [EXL](https://www.exlservice.com/), where I transformed multiple slow and monolithic pre-existing data and machine learning projects built in propriety tools into fast, modular, interpretable and user-friendly solutions.

In general, I command strong hold in building and setting up data intensive solutions. Some of my key projects are listed [here](projects.html). I also undertake courses and [certifications](certificates.html) to keep myself up to date with this rapidly evolving domain. 

I have no defined interests 🙈 and take up and try different things. Trying to keep a memoir [here](https://www.instagram.com/boi_doingthings). Besides that, I am a watch afficionado and 🍺 buff.

I also try to maintain some lists for my:
