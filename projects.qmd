Over time, I have got hands dirty in projects from multiple realms. Here is a snapshot.

## Professional
### Generative AI  
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `langchain`,`GPTs`, `OpenAI`, `Vector DataStores`,`whisper`,`gpt-4`,`LLaMA`
 
* [SRT] Engineered "SR-Copilot", a RAG-based application, to streamline e-commerce and SR product interactions by
efficiently addressing user queries and suggesting pertinent products and support ticket updates.  [Link](https://copilot.shiprocket.in/)  

* [SRT] Prototyped an automated pipeline for processing customer support calls, rating interaction quality, transcribing content,
identifying key pointers, and assessing buyer sentiment. (ASR→NLP→TTS)  
**Impact**: Reduced the number of agent call service requests by 7.6%.

* [SRT] Created a LLM-based chat app for non-technical stakeholders, to answer & execute database queries over Snowflake and Redshift in natural language.   

### Tabular Machine Learning
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `pandas`,`polars`,`xgboost`,`catboost`,`scikit-learn`,`rapids`,`dask`,`AWS Sagemaker`,`S3`,`ELK`

* [SRT] An ML pipeline that predicts a customers propensity to reject an ecommerce order at delivery. [Link](https://www.shiprocket.in/sense/)  
  **Impact**: Saved over 35MM in shipping costs for over 250+ D2C sellers.
* [SRT] An ML solution combining NLP and tabular data analysis to identify fraudulent seller behaviors.  
  **Impact**: Achieved 18% reduction in fraud cases of multiple categories (KYC, Weight Fraud etc).
* [WHJ] A classifier model to identify promising retention leads for sales pitch prioritization.  
  **Impact**: Enhanced retention performance by 8%. 
* [EXL] A suite of 12 ML models for an insurance client, that aims to mark a potential customers:  
  - propensity to respond and convert to a marketing campaign.
  - estimated chargeable premium and loss ratio, if converted.  
  Implemented an automated 1-window customer selection and offer allocation framework on top of models.    
  **Impact**:  The process boosted performance by +27%.


### Natural Language Processing
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `PyTorch`, `BERT`, `Word2Vec`, `NER`, `nltk`, `flashtext`, `gensim`, `rapidfuzz`,`transformers`,`sentiment analysis`,`semantic search`, `clustering`, `text similarity`

* [SRT] An unsupervised learning framework to enchance, standardise and validate over 6MM delivery addresses.  
  **Impact**: A SoTA address intelligence agent that can successfully parse over 100K localities from 500+ Indian districts.
* [SRT] Developed an address deduplication and syntax correction pipeline, whole suite led to +20% increased deliveries.  
  **Impact**: Successful identification of customers belonging to same household, leading to enhanced customer segmentations.  
* [SRT] Engineered an intelligent system for instant product categorization, categorising over 1.3 million uniquely named products.  
  **Impact**: Categorisation helped in better targeting for our other products.

### Clustering and Segmentation
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `DBSCAN`,`k-means`,`sklearn`,`ANOVA`,`noSQL`,`mongo`

* [SRT] Created a custom seller segmentation for 100K+ D2C sellers registered on the platform.
* [SRT] Designed a novel clustering method to segregate over 100 million unique buyers for tagging and behavioral analysis.
* [WHJ] An SQL-based segmentation for improved student-teacher mappings, for better learning outcomes.

### Forecasting and Geo-Spatial
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `fb-prophet`,`time-series analysis`, `ARIMA`, `kepler`, `geopandas`,`scipy`,`statmodels`,`spatial-clustering`  

* [SRT] Probed hyper-local e-commerce geo-coordinate data to identify ideal locations for dark stores.  
* [SRT] Undertook demand forecasting for fast moving goods for enhanced control over inventory and order management.

### Miscellaneous  
*Algo/Tools/Libraries Used:* `SQL`,`Redshift`,`Tableau`,`Snowflake`,`Excel`,`Google Workspace APIs`

* [ALL] Data Pipelines to establish data for training and to update the features for inference.
* [ALL] Custom dashboards and reports in GSheets and Tableau to track performance of models and raise flags for changes.
* [EXL] Uncoverted unoptimised SAS-based code to R and Python modules, for faster processing and cheaper executions by saving license costs.
* [EXL] Optimised SQL data processing pipelines from Oracle to Redshift.


## Personal 

### Generative AI    
* A audio to text ML app that converts expenses to JSON and builds a custom report. [Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/boi-doingthings/expense-converter)  
    
### Software Development    
* A bot that sends automated verses from Bhagvad Gita to a custom self maintained mailing lists.
* An [attempt](https://github.com/boi-doingthings/raspi-stack) to run a local file hosting via [NextCloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud) and ad-blocker, pihole over my Raspberry Pi.        

### Self Hosting
* A dedicated setup running commonly used apps over a on premise system and exposed to custom domain. [Link](heimdall.hsay.in)
  * Github: [Repo](https://github.com/boi-doingthings/self-hosted-stack)
